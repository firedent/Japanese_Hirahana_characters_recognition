# Japanese Hirahana characters recognition
This repo contains there parts to familiar with Pytorch lib and the implement of gradient descent with it.

Part1 includes the base math and torch operations.

Part2 impletes the activation, loss, forward and backward functions.

Part3 will use those functions impleted above to built a simple neural network for recognizing Japanese Hirahana characters.
